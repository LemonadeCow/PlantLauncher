# PlantLauncher

## Usage
The PlantLauncher is an application made to be used as a way to organize applications(mostly games) in a simple, fast, and effective manner. 

As of now it is only supported in Linux distributions (built in Pop!_OS)

## Why?
The app was made after my current distro Pop!_OS decided to update the applications tab and make it 1000x more annoying and difficult to use, 
so I put matters in my own hands and decided to program a whole app launcher for my applications in whichever way I seem fit.

***Oh linux I love you.***

## How to install/run
Well you can extract the code from github using 
    ```
    cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/LemonadeCow/PlantLauncher.git
    ```

As of now the application is really dumb and relies on being located in the home directory (will fix at some point)

for now compiling requieres python3 and installing wx (will upload instructions on downloading an executable at some point)
    `python3 -m pip install wx`
    
Now you're all good to go and can launch the application with the launch.sh script
